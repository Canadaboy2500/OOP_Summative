# OOP_Summative
What is the difference between OOP and Procedural coding?
Procedural coding works from top to bottom, meanwhile OOP focuses on extreme code encapsulation and repetition.

How would your program differ if it were made in procedural coding instead?
procedural coding would be a much much much slower process and require many many many redundancies to try to get the same result as OOP's class system.

What are the benefits of OOP?
OOP can be much shorter code and uses objects to easily store information and access and sort it. OOP also leads to much easier to expand upon code thanks to the robustness of the class system

What are the drawbacks?
OOP code is much much more complex and it takes a much longer time to set up a program as you must create all of your classes.
